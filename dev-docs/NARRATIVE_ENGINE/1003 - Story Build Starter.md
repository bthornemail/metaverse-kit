## Story Build Starter

### For Articles I–VIII as a Living, Replayable World

This is not a rewrite of your articles.
It is a **starter scaffold** that lets you turn them into a buildable, replayable story-world.

Think of this as:

* what are the base components
* what are the default roles
* what are the first scenes

So you can start projecting immediately.

---

## 1) Core Semantic Roles (Your Lego Blocks)

These are the minimal story-atoms your articles already use:

* Word / Logos
* Wisdom
* Law
* Identity / Belonging
* Measure / Number
* Witness / Scribe
* Boundary / Gate
* Flood / Collapse
* Tower / Ascent
* Conversation
* Restoration / Alignment

These become your **base component set**.

Every beat in every article can be tagged with one or more of these.

---

## 2) Default Component Types

Each beat can instantiate one of these component types:

* Voice

  * someone speaking, responding, confessing
* Relation

  * tension, agreement, conflict, alignment
* Boundary

  * gate, law, limit, threshold
* Structure

  * city, tower, system, ark
* Flow

  * flood, decay, movement, time
* Witness

  * scribe, observer, recorder
* Turning Point

  * revelation, collapse, restoration

These are not visuals.
They are meaning-roles.

## 3) Article-to-Scene Mapping

Treat each Article as a **chapter scene**.

### Scene I — The Gate of the City

(Article I)

Core roles:

* Wisdom
* Law
* Identity
* Boundary (Gate)
* Conversation

Scene meaning:

* Three priorities meet at a threshold.
* None is complete alone.
* Meaning arises between voices.

This becomes your first “world scene”:

* a gate or threshold
* three positions
* a shared center of tension

---

### Scene II — Measure Without Meaning

(Articles II–III theme)

Core roles:

* Number
* Measure
* Reduction
* Witness

Scene meaning:

* Counting replaces seeing.
* Measure loses Logos.
* People become invisible.

This becomes:

* grids, scales, rankings, ledgers
* contrasted with uncountable figures

---

### Scene III — Revelation as Unveiling

(Article III continuation)

Core roles:

* Revelation
* Exposure
* Choice

Scene meaning:

* Not destruction, but disclosure.
* The false god is revealed as a tool.

This becomes:

* masks falling
* mirrors cracking
* hidden relations becoming visible

---

### Scene IV — Logos Reclaims Number

(Article IV)

Core roles:

* Alignment
* Rest
* Harmony
* Spheres

Scene meaning:

* Number returns to service.
* Rest interrupts domination.
* Difference can coexist.

This becomes:

* rotating spheres
* touching without crushing
* rhythm instead of grid

---

### Scene V — The Human Voice

(Article V)

Core roles:

* Confession
* Memory
* Responsibility

Scene meaning:

* Humanity answers Logos.
* Admits substitution.
* Chooses responsibility.

This becomes:

* a collective voice
* many tones, not one
* speaking into open space

---

### Scene VI — Preservation Through Difference

(Article VI theme)

Core roles:

* Flood
* Ark
* Preservation
* Plurality

Scene meaning:

* Collapse erases forms, not memory.
* Difference saves the world.

This becomes:

* rising waters or dissolving structures
* an ark-like repository of kinds

---

### Scene VII — The Interrupted Tower

(Article VII theme)

Core roles:

* Tower
* Ascent
* Interruption
* Language

Scene meaning:

* Unity without wisdom collapses.
* Plurality is protection.

This becomes:

* rising structure
* sudden pause
* scattering into many voices

---

### Scene VIII — The Scribe and the Watcher

(Article VIII)

Core roles:

* Witness
* Boundary
* Observation
* Record

Scene meaning:

* One who sees without ruling.
* Records without owning.
* Stands between power and people.

This becomes:

* an elevated viewpoint
* not a throne, but a boundary
* watching without intervening

---

## 4) Base Scene Geometry (Abstract, Not Visual)

You only need a few spatial metaphors:

* Threshold / Gate
* Center / Gathering place
* Vertical axis (ascent/descent)
* Horizontal spread (plurality)
* Flow direction (time, flood, decay)

Every scene can be arranged using these five ideas.

---

## 5) First Buildable World Layout

Start with a simple world graph:

* Node: Gate Scene

  * links to:

    * Measure Scene
    * Conversation Scene

* Measure Scene

  * links to:

    * Revelation Scene

* Revelation Scene

  * links to:

    * Alignment Scene

* Alignment Scene

  * links to:

    * Human Voice Scene

* Human Voice Scene

  * links to:

    * Flood Scene
    * Tower Scene

* Flood Scene

  * links to:

    * Watcher Scene

* Tower Scene

  * links to:

    * Watcher Scene

This creates a loopable, replayable path.

---

## 6) Starter Beat Template

Every beat you add should answer:

* Who speaks or acts?
* What role are they embodying?
* What relation changes?
* What boundary is touched?
* What is revealed or hidden?

That’s enough to build endlessly.

## 7) Minimal “Starter Kit” for You

So your practical starter is:

* Semantic roles: the 12 listed above
* Component types: Voice, Relation, Boundary, Structure, Flow, Witness, Turning
* Scenes: 8 scenes mapped to your Articles
* World graph: simple linked structure
* Rule: meaning first, appearance later

With just this, you can:

* tag your articles
* split them into beats
* place them into scenes
* and start projecting them as:

1D – story
2D – diagram
Voxel – structure
3D – world

Without rewriting a single word.
