# Architecture Preservation License (APL) - Draft

This license is an intent statement until finalized. It is meant to preserve the core
architecture and invariants of the Metaverse Kit while enabling research and collaboration.

## Core Requirements

1. Preserve the append-only event ledger model and deterministic replay semantics.
2. Preserve the local-first, offline-capable design and opportunistic synchronization.
3. Preserve the separation of host, worker, and client runtimes.
4. Maintain explicit scope and authority boundaries in any derived implementation.
5. Provide clear attribution to the original Metaverse Kit project.

## Allowances

- You may study, fork, and experiment with the code and ideas.
- You may build compatible implementations that retain the invariants above.

## Restrictions

- You may not represent a modified architecture as compliant if it violates the core
  requirements listed above.
