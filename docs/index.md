A distributed, local-first collaborative infinite canvas metaverse built on append-only event traces.

## Documentation

- README: `README.md`
- Quick Start: `QUICKSTART.md`
- Publishing: `PUBLISHING.md`
- Implementation Plan: `dev-docs/PLANS/Implementation Plan.md`

## Architecture

The system is built around an append-only event ledger, deterministic replay, and projections that are derived rather than authored. The core invariants are documented in `dev-docs/`.
